description: 'If this is "on", the layout options will also need to be reversed. <em>Example: For mobile we want an image in Column 1 to be first (top), with text in Column 2 last (bottom). We then want a two-third/one-third layout for desktop, with text first (left), image second (right). Turn "Reverse" to "on", but then choose the "Layout 33/67%" to achieve the desired result.'
